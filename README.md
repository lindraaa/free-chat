# free-chat

Simple local web demo for experimenting with a chat-like UI.

This project is intentionally small and runs entirely in the browser.

## Quick start

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click it or open from your browser file menu).
2. Or run a local static server from the project root:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Files

- `index.html` — main HTML page and UI
- `index.js` — JavaScript for client-side behavior
- `package.json` — project metadata (optional)

## Requirements

- A modern web browser. No server is required for basic use.

## Contributing

Small, focused contributions welcome. Create a branch, make changes, and open a pull request.

## License

This repository has no license file. If you plan to share the project, add a LICENSE that fits your needs.
